Danger Very Close (DVC) is a first-person shooter game about using precision airstrikes and skilled movement. 

Although classic-style shooters made a resurgence in the middle of the 2010s, most have taken their design directly from their inspirations, with limited attempts to blend in different genres or more-modern influences. Among those that do, weapons where the projectile originates from a source other than the player are rare or nonexistent.

DVC takes a different approach by combining skilled movement with indirect-fire weapons inspired by Earth Defense Force 5â€™s Air Raider arsenal. The fact that most attacks originate from a platform separate from the player means that attacks can arrive or be sustained while the player would normally be unable to attack, enabling new strategies.
